Perfect timing 🚀 — building **small projects in TypeScript** will give you a real grip on the language beyond syntax.
Here’s a list of **practice projects** (beginner → advanced), all small enough to finish in a few hours each.

## 🔹 **Beginner Projects (Console-based)**

1. **Calculator CLI**

   * Input: two numbers + operator (+, -, \*, /).
   * Output: result.
   * Practice: Type annotations, conditionals, functions.

2. **To-Do List (Console App)**

   * Add, remove, list tasks.
   * Practice: Arrays, interfaces, enums.

3. **Guess the Number Game**

   * Random number generated (1–100).
   * User keeps guessing until correct.
   * Practice: Loops, conditionals, type narrowing.

4. **Word Counter**

## 🔹 **Intermediate Projects (Browser or Node.js)**

5. **Contact Book**

   * Store contacts `{name, phone, email}`.
   * Add, search, delete.
   * Practice: Interfaces, classes, generics.

6. **Expense Tracker**

   * Track expenses with categories.
   * Show total and per-category sum.
   * Practice: Arrays, objects, enums.

7. **Weather App (API-based)**

   * Fetch current weather using [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
   * Display temperature, description, location.
   * Practice: `fetch`, async/await, types for API responses.

8. **GitHub Profile Viewer**

   * Input: GitHub username.
   * Output: name, avatar, repo count.
   * Practice: API calls, optional chaining, interfaces.

## 🔹 **Advanced Small Projects**

9. **Quiz App**

   * Multiple choice questions.
   * Track score.
   * Practice: Strong typing with arrays of objects.

10. **Chat App (Mock)**

* Simple UI for sending/receiving messages.
* No backend, just local state.
* Practice: TypeScript with React or Vue.

11. **Notes App**

* Add, delete, edit notes.
* Store in `localStorage`.
* Practice: TypeScript + DOM APIs.

⚡ Tip:
Start with **console-based projects** (no HTML/React), then move to **API-based or browser-based projects** once you’re comfortable.

👉 Do you want me to **pick one beginner project (like Calculator or To-Do List)** and write the full **TypeScript implementation** for you so you can use it as a template?
